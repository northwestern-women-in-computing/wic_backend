# Fixing 401 Authentication Error

Your deployment is working, but it has **Deployment Protection** enabled, which requires authentication to access.

## Solution: Disable Deployment Protection

1. Go to your Vercel project:
   https://vercel.com/wic-northwesterns-projects/wic-backend

2. Go to **Settings** → **Deployment Protection**

3. You'll see options like:
   - **Password Protection**
   - **Vercel Authentication** (SSO)
   - **IP Allowlist**

4. **Disable all protection** for Production deployments:
   - Set Production to **"No Protection"** or **"Public"**
   - You can keep protection on Preview deployments if you want

5. **Save** the settings

6. The deployment should now be publicly accessible

## Alternative: Use Production Domain

Sometimes the production domain (`wic-backend.vercel.app`) doesn't have protection enabled, while preview URLs do. Check if:
- `https://wic-backend.vercel.app/api/leaderboard` works without authentication

## Why This Happened

Vercel sometimes enables deployment protection by default for:
- Team/organization projects
- Projects with certain settings
- Security best practices

For a public API, you'll want to disable this protection.
